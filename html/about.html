          <h2>5738 (1978)</h2>
          <p>In 5738 (1978), a small group of students at 770 felt a need to respond to the ever-widening circle of students and adults
          who identified as Lubavitcher chassidim, but could not understand the Rebbe’s talks because of the language barrier. Those
          students began to translate the Rebbe’s talks and to circulate them throughout the Crown Heights community.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <p>As the demand for these translations spread, the Rebbe’s talks were sent out around the world, and there was a need to formalize
          the organizational process. It was then that SIE – Sichos In English – was born.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <p>Rabbi Yonah Avtzon assumed the directorship of the organization and the primary responsibility for translation was undertaken
          by Rabbi Eliyahu Touger, except for the years between 5741 (1990) and 5748 (1998), when the main translators were Rabbi Yosef
          Loebenstein and then Rabbi Sholom Ber Hecht.</p>

          <h2>5746 (1986)</h2>
          <p>Beginning in 5746 (1986), in response to a widespread demand for the translation of earlier classic chassidic texts, Uri
          Kaploun and Rabbi Sholom Ber Wineberg were entrusted with this task.</p>

          <h2>5752 (1992)</h2>
          <p>From SIE’s beginnings in 5739 (1978) to 5752 (1992), the primary focus of SIE had been to communicate the Rebbe’s words to
          its ever-growing readership, and with the help of Fax-a-Sichah,the talks were rapidly transmitted to thousands of readers
          in Jewish communities throughout the world. After 27th Adar, 5752 (1992), SIE adjusted its mission and focused on providing
          translations and adaptations of the Rebbe’s edited works as well as earlier classic chassidic texts, and that mission is
          being pursued to this day with ever-increasing vigor.</p>
